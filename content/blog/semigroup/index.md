Composability is arguably one of the strongest features of functional programming paradigm because it allows us to write modular code and achieve complex behavior by composing the smaller pieces together. _What does it mean to combine things together?_

We already know how to combine things like strings:

```ts
const combinedString = "Hello " + "world!" // "Hello world!"
const combinedArrayOfStrings = ["This", "would", "be", "tedious", "otherwise", "!"].join(' ') // "This would be tedious otherwise!"

```
